This repository consists of Jupyter Notebook which shows the implementation of Exploratory Data Analysis, and Machine learning models on Red Wine Quality Dataset.

The dataset had many features which had to pre-processed and transfored to build the Model. The various independent features in the dataset were:
<ol>
<li>Fixed acidity: It indicates the amount of tartaric acid in wine.</li>

<li>Volatile acidity: It indicates the amount of acetic acid in the wine.</li>

<li>Citric acid: It indicates the amount of citric acid in the wine.</li>

<li>Residual sugar: It indicates the amount of sugar left in the wine after the fermentation process is done.</li>

<li>Free sulfur dioxide: It measures the amount of sulfur dioxide (SO2) in free form.</li>

<li>Total sulfur dioxide: It measures the total amount of SO2 in the wine. This chemical works as an antioxidant and antimicrobial agent.</li>

<li>Density: It indicates the density of the wine.</li>

<li>pH: It indicates the pH value of the wine. The range of value is between 0 to 14.0, which indicates very high acidity, and 14 indicates basic acidity.</li>

<li>Sulphates: It indicates the amount of potassium sulphate in the wine.</li>

<li>Alcohol: It indicates the alcohol content in the wine.</li>

<li>Quality: It indicates the quality of the wine, which is ranged from 1 to 10. Here, the higher the value is, the better the wine.</li>
</ol>

The code is written in Python 3.6.10.
